The front end(how the application looks) of this application has been created using  Javascript, HTML5 and CSS. 

To interact with the application:
1. Download xampp and install it
2. Extract the zip folder to "htdocs" in the xampp folder inside your computer's local disk
3. Open the xampp application and click "Start" and "Admin" for Apache and MySql.
4. Import the food_orderingsite.sql file to phpmyadmin
5. Run the index.php file or
6. Type localhost/foodOrderingSite/ into your browser's address bar proceed to use the application as desired

The menu bar will help you navigate to the major pages of the application to:
a. View the menu
b. View the login page
c. View the join page
d. View the contacts page

If the restaurant account admin is logged in
The menu bar will help them navigate:
a. The menus from all member restaurants
b. Their menu
c. Orders to their restaurant
d. The contacts page



A user is meant to visit the home page when they first get onto the application and proceed to the menu to add a meal into their cart and then checkout by pay via mpesa as well as specifying the time they would like their order to arrive. Their location will be automatically uploaded if they give permission to their browser for this information's access

Another user who is the admin of a Restaurant can create an account by clicking "Join" on the navigation bar and then entering their details as dictated by the form on the register.php page. They can upload meals onto their restaurants menu for customers to view on the menu.php page and view the ordered meals on orders.php.The orders.php page also shows the total overall revenue and orders. They can also edit their restaurant's menu.

Finishing touches are underway to further enhance the project.
